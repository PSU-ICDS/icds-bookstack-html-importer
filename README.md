# icds_html_bookstack_importer
Some scripts and an additional readme to help migrate content from Atlassian Confluence over to Bookstack. These are modifiied from Oddity Engineers Bookstack-HTML-Importer to better format titles and to add titles for cases in which the HTML export doesn't seem to provide them. These are a work in progress thus far and not representative of what I will leave here.
